                    <h1>Chad and Ryan's Story</h1>
                    <p class="ex1" style="font-size:40px; font-style: italic; font-family:serif; font-variant: small-caps;">it all started with a pair of skinny jeans...<span style="font-size:24px; font-family:times; font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;">  In 2012, Chad was working in the retail store, American Eagle in the Town Center Mall in Boca Raton, FL.  One day, Ryan saw Chad and was eager to go and speak to him, and  with a little encouragement, Ryan went into the store.  Chad noticed Ryan and decided to try to sell him a pair of skinny jeans that were noticeably three(!) sizes to large.  
      <img src="/assets/letshaveadrink.jpg" alt="Ryan's first beer at the Wine Maestro in Statesville, NC" style="float:left; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">Even though the jeans ended up not fitting, it was obvious that Chad was interested, and Ryan ended up getting a job there.  Eventually the two began dating, and by the end of the year Ryan had moved in with Chad as he finished his undergraduate studies at Florida Atlantic University.   <br>  In 2013 one of the most memorable trips was to Marathon and Key West, FL.  During this trip Chad and Ryan got to explore the Florida Keys including jet skiing in crystal blue waters, eating lots of key lime pie, and leaving a dollar bill at the famous, 
      <img src="/assets/ryanandchadoneyear.jpg" alt="One dollar bill decorated to commemorate 1 year anniversary" style="float:Right; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">"Robbie's" in Islamorada, FL to commemorate their first anniversary. Some other travels included trips to Chad's home in North Carolina where they went on some amazing hikes, got lost in the woods (a few times), and visited several of NC's best wineries.  Some of the most favorite hikes they enjoy are at Stone Mountain State Park, Hanging Rock State Park, and Pilot Mountain State Park. One of Ryan's favorite wineries is RayLen Vinyards were he grew fond of the Pale Red vintage, while Chad is a fan of their five-grape red bend, the Category 5. <br> In 2016 Chad and Ryan were able to share their love of music at the inagural Okeechobee Music Festival and were able to camp in the
      <img src="/assets/chadandryanrocknroll.jpg" alt="Chad and Ryan at a concert with the band's drumstick" style="float:left; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">middle of Florida at the Catifish Creek Preserve. By 2017, Chad had completed his Masters' degree in Bioengineering and Ryan was completing his AA degree at Palm Beach State University. Chad was continued his career working in prosthetic research and began working at ADMA Biologics, while Ryan continued to work in Town Center Mall and finish his degree. One of their most adventurous trips was driving across Utah to Colorado in the middle of the summer. Chad got to show Ryan where he spent his senior highschool year in Park City, UT. It was amazing time between the
      <img src="/assets/Chad Ryan Mesa-2.jpg" alt="Chad and Ryan between two mesas in the background with crisp blue sky" style="float:Right; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">hours of towering desert mesas, deep underground caves, and natural hot spring pools.  One of the most extreme trips was mountainbiking the Slickrock Trail in Moab, UT, where you can nearly bike up vertical rock face. <br> On December 28<sup>th</sup>, 2018, Chad took Ryan back to RayLen Vineyard in NC, where he took Ryan on a tour of the vineyard and production rooms.  Unbeknownst to Ryan, RayLen actually never gave tours, and Chad actually had another plan in mind, he got down on one knee and proposed to Ryan.  
      <img src="/assets/Engaged hands.jpg" alt="Two hands holding with engagement rings on" style="float:left; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">However, there was a problem with the rings logistically.  As a result, Chad had two pairs of American Eagle Skinny Jeans (this time the right size) embroidered with one saying on the back pocket, "It All Began With" and the second, "A Pair of Skinny Jeans".  So when Chad proposed to Ryan it was very fitting the he finally was able to find Ryan the correctly sized skinny jeans. <br>During the end of 2020 Chad and Ryan were priviledged to welcome many changes to their lives including adopting a six month old puppy, Maximo "Max" who was rescued from Puerto Rico. Max is a very special dog, and quite unique just like his owners. 
       <img src="/assets/Skinny Jeans.jpg" alt="Two pairs of jeans with the back embroidered with text" style="float: Right; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;"> Furthermore, in the middle of Winter they moved to the Boston area to eventually settle in the city of Quincy.  Chad transitioned his career in biopharamacutical developemnt in the plasma protein and therapeutics industry to the up and coming Cell and Gene Therapy start-up industry, and landed first at SQZ Biotech and eventually to his current role at Sana Biotechnology.  Ryan began working as a sales lead manager at REI.  Both have had much success in their work, and thoroughly enjoy the seasons of the Northeast US.  
       <img src="/assets/chadandryan-2.png" alt="alt text" style="float:left; object-fit:contain; width:200px;height:300px;">Both enjoy hiking the inter-city and foothill trails during the Spring, taking trips to the cape and Martha's Vineyard during the Summer, watching the leaves turn driving and hiking off the Kancamagus Highway in the White Mountains of NH during the Fall, and skiing and snowboarding over many mountains in the Winter On Decemeber 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021 the two were married in a civil ceremony at Quincy City Hall.  </span>
