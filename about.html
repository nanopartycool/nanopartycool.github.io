		<h3>What I Do</h3>
		<p>I like to solve real world problems through my passions. I have deep knowledge of both microbiology and bioengineering techniques.</p>
		<p>Using this knowledge, I apply my skills to new and cutting-edge disciplines,  ultimately leading to beneficial technology development in disease diagnostics, microfluidic bioengineering and 3-D printing applications in prosthetics.  I have devised laser cutting and fused deposition modeling techniques for platform implantation for low cost and easy reproducibility. I've ascertained these rapid prototyping skills, from my experience in the biomedical engineering research at Asghar Micro- and Nanotechnology in Medicine Lab. At Asghar Lab, I work with engineers and digital signal processors to develop equipment and algorithms that help diagnose diseases like HIV and Zika.</p>
		<p>In my free time I enjoy volunteering my time as the Director of (Dis)Ability Diversity, for the Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (oSTEM) national organization.  This is a national LGBTQ+ organization that connects both industry professionals and undergrad, graduate and post-doctorate students together at annual conferences.   In my role I am able to serve those LGBTQ+ in STEM identifying as (dis)abled, by fostering new global initiatives and programming bringing visibility to intersectional LGBTQ+ identities, highlighting accessibility challenges we all face and must overcome, and providing invaluable resources for equal access. <p>

		<h3>Why I Do This</h3>
		<p>
		 I have overcome paralysis, physical (dis)ability and other adversity.  Facing these challenges I found my passion was key to my success. Following my passions for microbiology led me to wanting to change the status quo always and seek a means for better treatments, better diagnostics and greater access to care. That's why I became a bioengineer.
