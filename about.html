		<h3>What I Do</h3>
		<p>I build things and write code. I have deep knowledge of both hardware and software.</p>
		<p>Two years ago, I fell in love with research. Ever since, I've dedicated my prototyping skills, programming aptitude, and free time toward the biomedical engineering research at Asghar Nanotechnology in Medicine Lab. At Asghar Lab, I work with biologists to develop equipment and algorithms that help diagnose diseases like HIV and Zika.</p>

		<h3>Why I Do This</h3>
		<p>
		I believe that there is something truly special about math. To manipulate and understand a system governed solely by a set of logically-consistent principles is one of life's great joys. And the feeling when you synthesize a particularly complex system and persuade it to do something useful? That's why I became an engineer.
